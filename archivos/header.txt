Hello soldier üßë‚Äç‚úàÔ∏è. Welcome to your new mission.
Emojibert is at risk and you are the only one that can help him.
He was captured by the enemy ü•∑ and they got him into the metaverse. 
What you are seeing below is the digitized version of his real time execution.
Problem is: You experience in real life everything you experience in the Metaverse. üò±
The only way to save him is for you to guess a word the enemy has encrypted.
It ins your hands. GOOD LUCK SOLDIER
